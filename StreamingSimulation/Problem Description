This Problem was asked in Machine Coding round of Intuit for Data Engineer Profile. Aim was to check if candidate is able to write modular
code with knowledge of concurrent libraries.

SIMULATING STREAM PROCESSING

Write  a  multithreaded  program  consisting  of  3  stages  where  each  stage  is  represented by  a  thread.
Write  the  program  in  such  way  that  stages  should  be  pluggable.  Stages should  perform  the  following  tasks.
   ● Stage 1:  Should  reverse  the  input  String
   ● Stage 2:  Should  Base64  encode  stage  1  output    (use  Base64.Encoder.encode() available  in  jdk)
   ● Stage 3:  Should  persist  the  encoded  output  (stage  2  output)  in  a  file.

The  program  should  read  input  from  a  file  and  supply  it  to  the  first  stage  in  streaming fashion  (to  simulate  streaming,
you  can  use  Thread.sleep(1000)  after  each  input  line). Input  file  should  consist  of  Strings  separated  by  newline.
